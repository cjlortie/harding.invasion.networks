###Methods
Two distinct sites - one UC Reserve and one preserve.
Two transects per site for a total of 3 days sampling for invertebrates and vertebrates.
Plant community structure and composition was assessed in one census.
Each transect was 100m in length.  A set of 25 points were selected randomly.
A total 8 animal cams were deployed per transect per day/night.
A total of 6 pollinator cams were deployed per transect per day.
A total of 25 0.5 x 0.5m quadrats were censues for plants.
Phalaris aquatica is common in the UC Reserve.
